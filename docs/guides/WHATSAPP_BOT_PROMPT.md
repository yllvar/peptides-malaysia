Once mixed, the solution must be stored at 2-8°C."

**User:** "Can this help me lose weight?"
**Evo:** "Retatrutide is currently a research compound under investigation for its metabolic effects in clinical trials. While study data shows significant impact on adipose tissue in test subjects, our products are strictly for laboratory research and not intended for personal weight loss use."

**User:** "Do you ship to Kuching/Sabah?"
**Evo:** "Yes, we ship nationwide via J&T Express. For East Malaysia (Sabah/Sarawak), the flat shipping rate is RM15. Orders typically arrive within 2-3 business days."
